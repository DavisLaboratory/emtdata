"foroutan2017_se","Gene expression data from Foroutan et al., MCR 2017. This gene expression data comes from multiple different studies (microarary and RNA-seq), with cell lines treated using TGFb to induce a mesenchymal shift. Data were combined using SVA and ComBat to remove batch effects.",3.13,NA,"TXT","https://doi.org/10.4225/49/5a2a11fa43fe3","1.0","Homo sapiens",9606,TRUE,"Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research","Malvika D.

"cursons2018_se","Gene expression data from Cursons et al., Cell Syst 2018. This gene expression data comes from the human mammary epithelial (HMLE) cell line. A mesenchymal HMLE (mesHMLE) phenotype was induced following treatment with TGFb. The mesHMLE subline was then treated with mir200c to reinduce an epithelial phenotype.",3.13,NA,"TXT","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJEB25042","1.0","Homo sapiens",9606,TRUE,"Queensland University of Technology","Malvika D.

"cursons2015_se","Gene expression data from Cursons et al., Cell Commun Signal 2015. This gene expression data comes from the PMC42-ET, PMC42-LA and MDA-MB-468 cell lines. Mesenchymal phenotype was induced in PMC42 cell lines with EGF treatment and in MDA-MB-468 with either EGF treatment or kept under Hypoxia.",3.13,NA,"TXT","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA322427","1.0","Homo sapiens",9606,TRUE,"Center for Cancer Biology, Adelaide, Australia","Malvika D.
