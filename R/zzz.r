#' TGFb stimulated cell lines from Foroutan et al. (2017)
#'
#' Foroutan et al. collected data from multiple different studies where various
#' cell lines (from various tissues of origin) were stimulated with transforming
#' growth factor beta (TGFb) to induce an epithelial to mesenchymal transition
#' (EMT). Since the data were from different studies (and platforms), the
#' removal of unwanted variation (RUV) approach was applied to discard batch
#' effects.
#'
#' Data from this publication were downloaded from figshare and processed into a
#' SummarizedExperiment object. Sample annotations were retrieved from the
#' original publication.
